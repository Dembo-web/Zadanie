        <p>Why do they always send the poor?!
          <br> Barbarisms by Barbaras with pointed heels
          <br> Victorious victories kneel for brand new spankin' deals
          <br> Marching forward hypocrite and hypnotic computers
          <br> You depend on our protectio Yet you feed us lies from the tablecloth</p>
          <p>Everybody's going to the party have a real good time
            <br> Dancing in the desert blowing up the sunshine</p>
            <p>Kneeling roses disappearing into Moses' dry mouth
              <br> Breaking into Fort Knox stealing our intentions
              <br> Hangers sitting dripped in oil
              <br> Crying freedom
              <br> Handed to absolution
              <br> Still you feed us lies from the tablloth</p>
